In this project we had used Behaviour cloning technique and trained a neural network with the images from the car (working in a simulator) 
of front , left, right side and then processed the images by cleaning the data by removing unwanted part of image, fine tuned and resized the images. 
On the basis of the images it predicts the left and right turns. Moreover to stop the car we used Lidar sensors that will detect the object in the path. 
We had created a working Prototype of this car. 

Raspberry Pi module is used to run the application and work with Lidar, a battery pack is installed in the car
